        <p>
           Most of us are familiar with the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcard">postcard</a>. By default, they are a simple and lightweight way of staying in touch. Likely few of us send postcards physically (often), which is too bad because they are a beautiful concept.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you can easily send postcards (virtually). All you have to do is:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose a photo from your camera roll</li>
            <li>Type "a postcard" from (wherever you are)</li>
            <li>Write a paragraph or some text (that would theoretically fit on the back side of your photo) which paints some sort of picture of your experience.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            That's it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lovely thing about this format is it's open! You can do it via text, email, or who knows!
